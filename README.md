## How to Install

Go to the green **Clone or download** button, click it, then click _Download ZIP_. Then, unpack the .zip, including _all_ files, to some folder.

As always, there's the Cool Kid option of cloning this git repo. That is preferable, since you can update simply by `pulling` this repo.

## Usage

```
python chem.py ... 
```

chem.py depends on [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.6 and above.

Note that the command to invoke Python may be different (e.g. `python3`), so adjust accordingly.
